"""
    main(; kwargs...)
    
Creates a simple path graph, constructs the Ising tensor network on it, and computes the
partition function Z by contracting the tensor network.

# Keywords
- `beta::Number = 0.2`: The inverse temperature parameter.
- `outputlevel::Int = 1`: Controls how much information will be printed by the script.

# Returns
A named tuple containing:
- `tn::Dict{Any, ITensor}`: The tensor network representation of the Ising model on the graph.
- `g::NamedGraph`: The created graph.
- `z::Number`: The partition function Z computed by contracting the tensor network.
